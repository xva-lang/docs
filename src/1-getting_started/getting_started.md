# Introduction

Xva is a statically-typed, compile-time checked and interpreted programming language that strives to help you write safe, efficient and readable code. Xva is designed to be accessible for all, from veterans with decades of experience to those who have never touched any kind of programming before.

Throughout this documentation, we will provide examples of how Xva works, why Xva works the way that it does, and some recommendations on how to write the best Xva code you can. There are some references to the word _compiler_ in this book however, at its current version, Xva is still interpreted. The meaning of the word _compiler_ is a bit of a misnomer, but it refers to Xva's suite of compile-time checks on your code.

We hope you enjoy learning about Xva, and have fun!
